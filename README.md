## 🚀 Key Innovation: Solving the Literacy Gap
[cite_start]As a freshman at Stanford[cite: 1, 3], I developed this system to replace millions of paper tally marks with a digital infrastructure designed for users with limited digital literacy.

### ⚙️ Custom Automation Features
* **Intelligent Clock-In:** Developed Java logic that automatically assigns staff to clinics and logs work hours based on the first and last patient entries of the day.
* **Smart Inventory:** Custom medicine tracking that deducts stock (e.g., ITRIM 200, Almox-500) in real-time as treatments are recorded.
* **History Retrieval:** Uses patient IDs to instantly display weight, BP, and blood sugar trends from previous visits.
* **Data Export:** Automated transformation of NoSQL data into structured sheets for humanitarian leadership analysis.
