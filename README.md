## 🎯 The Mission
[cite_start]I led a team of 30+ to replace paper-based record-keeping (millions of tally marks) with a digital infrastructure for mobile hospitals[cite: 12, 13].

When I first connected with Parivaar, I found that each "tally mark" was a person reduced by the limits of paper. [cite_start]I taught myself Android Studio to build a solution that preserves patient dignity and ensures long-term care[cite: 14].

## ⚙️ How it Works
* [cite_start]**Longitudinal Care:** Uses IDs to pull historical symptoms, weight, and blood sugar trends to prevent medical oversights[cite: 12].
* **Staff Automation:** System automatically handles clock-ins and location assignments for doctors and drivers based on mobile clinic activity.
* **Inventory Tracking:** Real-time stock levels update as medicines (e.g., ITRIM 200, Almox-500) are prescribed.
* [cite_start]**Resilient Sync:** Built for remote areas; data persists locally and syncs to Firebase Cloud Firestore when connectivity is restored[cite: 12].
